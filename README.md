## Description

Behold the backend. This is the back-end RESTful API for an e-commerce website. All routes for creating, updating reading, and deleting have been built out so you can build the front end and not have to worry about your database! End points are located in the routes folder, so open up insomnia or postman and try it out for yourself.
